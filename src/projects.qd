## Projects

I lost count of all the projects I've started throughout my journey in the field.
Some reached completion, many have never seen the light of day,
and only a handful became something I'm truly proud of.

Here are my favorites:

- [**Quarkdown**](https://github.com/iamgio/quarkdown) .br
  Born as a simple parser and renderer for a custom Markdown flavor,
  it has evolved into a full-fledged typesetting system.  
  Focused on ease of use and versatility, it allows generating papers, books,
  presentations, knowledge bases, and simple websites.

- [**Pikt**](https://github.com/iamgio/pikt) .br
  An esoteric programming language, where programs are represented as images,
  and each pixel's color encodes a specific instruction.  
  Made for fun, it turned out to be surprisingly powerful and Turing-complete,
  with both a JVM compiler and an interpreter.

- [**Animated**](https://github.com/iamgio/animated) .br
  A JavaFX library that adds support to implicit animations,
  typical of modern declarative UI frameworks like Flutter or SwiftUI.

- [**Chorus**](https://github.com/iamgio/chorus) .br
  The first YAML editor built specifically for Minecraft configuration files,
  with useful completions, previews, and a built-in SFTP and FTP client.

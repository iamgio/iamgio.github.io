I was instantly fascinated by the number of things one could do with it.
Aside from playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Tilt!_Pinball">Space Cadet</a>, I was obsessed with a single word: <em><strong>create</strong></em>.</p><p>I used to spend hours googling <em>how to create characters</em>, <em>how to create games</em>,
<em>how to create websites</em>,
trying to learn everything I could about making things.<br />It was when I found out about <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">GameMaker</a> that
my passion for software development truly ignited:
I was finally able to create my own games from scratch (kind of),
and that gave me an incredible sense of freedom, accomplishment,
and motivation to keep learning.
It wasn&rsquo;t long before I wrote my first lines of code, modding Minecraft
in ways that give me a good laugh today.</p><div style="justify-content: flex-start; align-items: center;" class="stack stack-row"><div class="clip clip-circle"><div class="container"><figure><img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16124324?v=4" alt="" style="width: 100.0px;" /></figure></div></div><p>&larr; that&rsquo;s me</p></div><p>Fast forward to this day, <em>create</em> is still my favorite word,
whether it&rsquo;s about software, design, or art.
I graduated in Computer Science and Engineering, and that gave me a solid foundation to build upon,
while keeping my curiosity and passion alive.
I&rsquo;m an advocate of clean code, good design, and user-centered development,
and an absolute open source enthusiast.</p><p>Now, the pinnacle of my creation journey is this website that you&rsquo;re browsing.
<strong>What?</strong>, you might ask. It&rsquo;s such a plain website, where are the flashy animations and creative stuff
you&rsquo;ve been bragging about?
Well, this page was made with <a href="https://github.com/iamgio/quarkdown">Quarkdown</a>,
my labor of love, that I built from the ground up, backed by the experience
that you can only get by <em>creating</em> things over and over again, failing, learning, and improving.</p><h2 id="projects">Projects</h2><p>I lost count of all the projects I&rsquo;ve started throughout my journey in the field.
Some reached completion, many have never seen the light of day,
and only a handful became something I&rsquo;m truly proud of.</p><p>Here are my favorites:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/iamgio/quarkdown"><strong>Quarkdown</strong></a> <br />
Born as a simple parser and renderer for a custom Markdown flavor,
it has evolved into a full-fledged typesetting system.<br />Focused on ease of use and versatility, it allows generating papers, books,
presentations, knowledge bases, and simple websites.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/iamgio/pikt"><strong>Pikt</strong></a> <br />
An esoteric programming language, where programs are represented as images,
and each pixel&rsquo;s color encodes a specific instruction.<br />Made for fun, it turned out to be surprisingly powerful and Turing-complete,
with both a JVM compiler and an interpreter.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/iamgio/animated"><strong>Animated</strong></a> <br />
A JavaFX library that adds support to implicit animations,
typical of modern declarative UI frameworks like Flutter or SwiftUI.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/iamgio/chorus"><strong>Chorus</strong></a> <br />
The first YAML editor built specifically for Minecraft configuration files,
with useful completions, previews, and a built-in SFTP and FTP client.</p></li></ul><h2 id="experience">Experience</h2><p>I&rsquo;m currently based in San Francisco as a full-stack engineer at <a href="https://falconer.com">Falconer</a>,
a startup focusing on building companies&rsquo; knowledge bases.
I&rsquo;m mainly contributing to the development of their visual editor.</p><p>In the meantime, I&rsquo;m also completing a Master&rsquo;s Degree in <em>Computer Science and Engineering</em>
at the University of Bologna, after earning my Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in the same field in 2024.</p><p>Previously, I worked at <a href="https://cosmobile.com">Cosmobile</a>,
leading the development of a modern iOS app for internal use.</p><h2 id="letrsquos-connect">Let&rsquo;s connect!</h2><div style="grid-template-columns: auto auto; justify-content: flex-start; align-items: center; gap: 1.0cm;" class="stack stack-grid"><p><a href="https://github.com/iamgio">GitHub</a><br /><span class="codespan-content"><code>iamgio</code></span></p><p><a href="https://t.me/iamgio">Telegram</a><br /><span class="codespan-content"><code>@iamgio</code></span></p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giorgio-garofalo/">LinkedIn</a><br /><span class="codespan-content"><code>in/giorgio-garofalo</code></span></p><p><a href="mailto:giorgiogarofalo02@gmail.com">E-mail</a><br /><span class="codespan-content"><code>giorgiogarofalo02@gmail.com</code></span></p></div>
